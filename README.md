# Python Projects
Inside of this repo you can find source code for a large majority of my Python projects and 
my work as a python beginner.
## Why Do I Have This?
I have made this repo because I am building a portfolio to possibly show an employer, and to spread my programs to others
this woulod be for teaching purposes, e.g. "find the errors in this code"
